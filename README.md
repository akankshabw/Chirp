These are the assignment submissions of the Chirp project offered by GDSC. The "Chirp" project aims to develop an efficient and accurate bird call recognition system using machine learning techniques. The primary goal is to enable the identification of bird species based on their unique vocalizations.

The "Numpy_Practice_Exercise.ipynb" notebook is the practice assignment which covers all the concepts of Numpy library.

The "EDA.ipynb" notebook is the assignment in which I have performed EDA of the "food_coded.csv" file.

The "Copy_of_FE.ipynb" file is an assignment in which I have extracted features from the audio folders "Number 5" and "Number 9" and tried to find common patterns between audios of the same number and differences between features of audios of different numbers so you can classify which audio represents which number. 

In "Neural_Network_Model.ipynb", I have created a Neural Network which classifies the audio files into various categories. The link to the dataset used in this assignment is: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Nh3wf1P47CGzUzBnecJMaog33R3vAuNb?usp=sharing

The final submission of this project was to build a Neural Network model which could recognize birdsongs of different birds. "Final_EDA.ipynb" and "Final_FE.ipynb" are the EDA and Feature Engineering files of the dataset used for training the model. The "final-model.ipynb" is the notebook for the final model.
