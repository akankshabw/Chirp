These are the assignment submissions of the Chirp project offered by GDSC. The "Chirp" project aims to develop an efficient and accurate bird call recognition system using machine learning techniques. The primary goal is to enable the identification of bird species based on their unique vocalizations.

The Numpy_Practice_Exercise.ipynb notebook is the practice assignment which covers all the concepts of Numpy library.
The EDA.ipynb notebook is the assignment in which I have performed EDA of the food_coded.csv file.
The Copy_of_FE.ipynb file is an assignment in which I have extracted features from the audio folders "Number 5" and "Number 9" and tried to find common patterns between audios of the same number and differences between features of audios of different numbers so you can classify which audio represents which number.
